> Long years ago, we made a tryst with destiny; and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.
<p align="right"> Jawaharlal Nehru's Tryst with Destiny speech, August 15, 1947 </p>

At what horizon does a dream transform reality? Because at the midnight hour, we wake to the language of the unfulfilled. A dense fog of symbols and meanings that permeate the immediate. A universe of forms that veil the vicissitudes of time and space. We imagine what the mirage reflects. Our dreams echo the rudiments of self. A faint memory that recalls harmony. A specter that transforms the formless and the void. What is real amid the chaos? What is illusion? A child is born neither awake nor asleep. And grasps for breadth. Why? To fulfill a dream. The infant cries. And consciousness. We jolt wake, open our eyes and recall we were sleep. But we continue dream.
