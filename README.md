> Long years ago, we made a tryst with destiny; and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.
> Jawaharlal Nehru's Tryst with Destiny speech, August 15, 1947


At what horizon does a dream transform reality? Because at the midnight hour, we wake to the language of the unfulfilled. A dense fog of symbols and meanings that permeate the immediate. A universe of forms that veil the vicissitudes of time and space. We imagine what the mirage reflects. Our dreams echo the rudiments of self. A faint memory that recalls harmony. A specter that transforms the formless and the void. What is real amidst the chaos? What is illusion? A child is born neither awake nor asleep. And grasps for breadth. Why? To fulfill a dream. A desire. Hope. The infant cries. And consciousness. 

The tryst precedes the body politic. The dream radiates amidst the void. India is a revery that spans languages, religions and polities. An anthology of the unvanquished. A negation that masquerades as identity. The not self. The Other. Ancient and without antecedent. A gospel not yet unfurled. A billion score people waking each morning to a shared reality. To realize Truth. That precedes the telegraph, the railroad and the automobile. That we are more than the sum of our histories. That our raison d'Ãªtre is beyond measure. And outside cause. 

And we persevere. Answer love. And breath life to India.
