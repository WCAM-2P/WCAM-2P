> Long years ago, we made a tryst with destiny; and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.
<p align="right"> Jawaharlal Nehru's Tryst with Destiny speech, August 15, 1947 </p>

At what horizon does a dream transform reality? Because at the midnight hour, we wake to the language of the unfulfilled. A dense fog of symbols and meanings that permeate the immediate. A universe of forms that veil the vicissitudes of time and space. We imagine what the mirage reflects. Our dreams echo the rudiments of self. A faint memory that recalls harmony. A specter that transforms the formless and the void. What is real amidst the chaos? What is illusion? A child is born neither awake nor asleep. And grasps for breadth. Why? To fulfill a dream. The infant cries. And consciousness.

The continuum flickers. The imagination conjures the phenomenal from the resonant. We discern at first the edges and then the constellation of the significant. A thought unfurls and we begin wander the desert in search of lost memory. An imago of preceding. A self unrealized. We chase figments across the sands. Our trysts colour our nights. We stumble past wonder and cross mystery. We emerge from strand amid stalks of wheat. We hear a rustling off in the distance, and draw to the siren of the train. We begin forget ourselves. And recall flashes of the dream. 

The train. A line. A gradient. An expression of the abstract. A species of the genus.
